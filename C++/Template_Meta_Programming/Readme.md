# Template Meta Programming

* Types have been used to specify what objects what store, but types themselves don't have any values.
* Using Template, It can assign any value to a type and operate with these types not create an object.



#### Meta Programming

* the type must be determined at a compile time, all operation are completed at compile time.
* Meta programming is Programming with code generated at compile time with types



#### Template Meta Programming

* In the case of C++, Since template can be used, meta Programming using Template is TMP (Template Meta Programming)
* Compile time increses because all operations are executed at compile time, but program speed can be improved. 
* TMP is difficult to debug and Code implementation, so not all code configured as TMP, but use in a special cases such as programming where speed is important.
