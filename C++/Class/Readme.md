### Class vs struct

* The difference from struct

  * default, member variable, member function.

  * base classes

    * struct is public / class is  private.

  * Class has a constructor and destructor, enforcing invariant

  * Struct just simple collection of values.

  * Class can be used to declare template parameters

    

  * In C++, struct and class have no distinction except for the above difference.

# Class

* Access Specifiers

  * public : Everyone
  * private : class itself and friend classes
  * protected : class itself and derived clasees and friend classes.

* Inheritance
